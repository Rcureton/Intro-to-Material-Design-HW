## Intro to Material Design Homework - Responses


##### Write at least 5 things that you like or dislike about the [Google Design Specifications](https://www.google.com/design/spec/material-design/introduction.html) website design.

1. What I like about the Google Material Design website is that it establishes a base for those who don't have the basic artist's touch.

2. What I also like is that it incorporates UX/UI with user consideration not just from the eyes of the developer.

3. Google has done a lot of market research when it comes to their own products so extending that base to users is very valuable.  

4. I like that it provides good design basics that changes and grows as new technology emerges

5. Lastly I like that their design incorporates more than one platform so it extends to all devices and theres little altering when it comes to catering to different devices.

##### Write at least 3 reasons why the [Google Design Specifications](https://www.google.com/design/spec/material-design/introduction.html) design follows Material Design guidelines. Be as specific as possible.

1. They follow the Material Design guidelines to develop a single underlying system that allows for a unified experience across platforms and device sizes. Mobile precepts are fundamental, but touch, voice, mouse, and keyboard are all ﬁrst-class input methods.

2. An emphasis on user actions makes core functionality immediately apparent and provides waypoints for the user.

3. Motion is meaningful and appropriate, serving to focus attention and maintain continuity. Feedback is subtle yet clear. Transitions are efﬁcient yet coherent.
